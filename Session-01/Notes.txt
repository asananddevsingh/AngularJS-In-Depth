JavaScript
==========

1. This language was created to do small data validations and DOM manipulation at the client side.

2. How many datatypes is supported in javascript (you can get it using typeof API).

There are onyl 6 types of datatypes that JS supports, those are:
    - typeof 123            = number    => Holds data
    - typeof "A"            = string    => Holds data
    - typeof true           = boolean   => Holds data
    - typeof {}             = object    => Collection of data
    - typeof undefined      = undefined => No data
    - typeof function(){}   = function  => function

* The underlying type of number type in JS is floating type.
    e.g
        var x = 1;
        x -= 0.05; => 0.95
        x -= 0.05; => 0.8999999999999999
        x -= 0.05; => 0.8499999999999999
        x -= 0.05; => 0.7999999999999998

Other than these, everything else comes under any one of the above types:

e.g:
    - typeof Date()     = string
    - typeof new Date() = object
    - typeof null       = object
    - typeof NaN        = number

3. Category of languages

Category 1:
     - Procedural
     - Object Oriented
     - Functional
            - Functions are first class citizens (functions are data).
